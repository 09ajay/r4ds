Might be quite brief.

## Data structures

Atomic vectors and lists. What is a data frame?

`typeof()` vs. `class()` mostly in context of how date/times and factors are built on top of simpler structures.

## Factors

(Since won't get a chapter of their own)

## Subsetting

Not sure where else this should be covered.
