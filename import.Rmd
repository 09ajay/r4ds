# Data import

## Overview

You can't apply any of the tools you've applied so far to your own work, unless you can get your own data into R. In this chapter, you'll learn how to import:

* Flat files (like csv) with readr.
* Database queries with DBI.
* Data from web APIs with httr.
* Binary file formats (like excel or sas), with haven and readxl.
